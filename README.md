## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `chevreuldata` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("chevreuldata")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/cobriniklab/chevreuldata) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("cobriniklab/chevreuldata")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library("chevreuldata")
